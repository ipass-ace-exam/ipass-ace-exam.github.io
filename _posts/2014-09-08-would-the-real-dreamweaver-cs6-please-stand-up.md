Over at iPassExam we’ve been receiving a few comments from our customers regarding the placement of options in menus for the Dreamweaver CS 6 exam.

**Why is this important?**

Some of the exam questions for the Dreamweaver CS6 exam ask specifically about menu options.  Unfortunately many of the menu options get moved when the software is patched.

**It gets worse**

To compound this problem there are two version of Dreamweaver CS6.  If you purchased Dreamweaver CS6 on a disk then you have the static version, also known as a perpetual licence version.  This is no longer upgraded and stopped on version 12.0.3.  You can download these patches from: [https://www.adobe.com/support/dreamweaver/downloads_updaters.html](https://www.adobe.com/support/dreamweaver/downloads_updaters.html).  

There is also a version of Dreamweaver CS6 available from Creative cloud.  This version is still receiving occasional tweaks and alterations to menu positions and other UI elements (including actual removal and addition of some items) this is currently at 12.2.x.

**So what version does the actual exam target?**

To get to the bottom of this question I had to pull out all the stops and contact every adobe contact in my address book. Not an easy task as many don’t return emails. Eventually though I received a reply from a Partner Certification Manager at adobe.

The answer is the Dreamweaver CS6 ACE exam is written for the last perpetual license version of the product (12.0.3).

So if you have the perpetual license version make sure you patch to the latest version.  

**What if  you’re using the Creative Cloud version of Dreamweaver CS6?**

My advice: If you have a Creative Cloud subscription we advise updating your Dreamweaver to CC and sitting the CC Exam.

Fortunately iPassExam has [sample exam questions for both the Dreamweaver CS6 and CC version of the exam](https://www.ipassexam.com/p/adobe-dreamweaver-exam-study).
