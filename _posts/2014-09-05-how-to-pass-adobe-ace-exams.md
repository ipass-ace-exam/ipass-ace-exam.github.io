So you've decided to go for it and sit an Adobe ACE exam - good for you.  While professional certification doesn't replace having a great portfolio it does show that you’re serious about your continued professional development.  This commitment could make the difference between getting that interview or not.

Adobe ACE exams vary in price between $55.00 and $359.00 although the majority are priced at: $180.00.  At this price it pays to be prepared, so what can you do to help avoid the cost of resitting?

Preparing for the Exam
----------------------

Thorough preparation is essential in order to succeed with the any exam. Putting in the time and effort will truly pay off when you know that you have studied and you achieve your desired grade.

Give yourself the best chance of passing and a smooth and stress free revision experience by following these tips:

**Allow yourself a quiet, clear and well lit space to study**

There's nothing worse than that feeling of frustration or restlessness that can come from noise and distraction.  It can draw out your learning process, making it arduous and unpleasant. A clear space can make it easier to concentrate. Good lighting will aid in better concentration too and prevent tired eyes and headaches.

**Plan to revise in a realistic way that works for you**

Locking yourself in a room and trying to tackle it all in a single day is going to cause a headache and possibly disappointment too. Plan your revision whether you schedule an hour or two per day into your work plan, or an hour in the evening at home. Take some time to think about your own revision style and focus on maintaining a steady pace. Remember to make sure that you take regular breaks with time to relax so that your mind stays fresh and interested.

**Note making is essential**

We are all individual, we all absorb information at different rates and through different methods. Take some time to think about how you best absorb information, whether you make notes, draw diagrams or flowcharts to remember layout and processes or stick post it notes around your home/office etc. These prompts are going to be a valuable aid in learning and taking the exam. Some people like to use memory techniques such as mind mapping. Others may find that they learn more visually for example and highlighting key points of information with a marker may help to digest it more easily.

**Get a feel for the exam**

We also encourage exam candidates to prepare using sample exam questions. iPassExam's questions are written in a similar style and theme as the exam, so they can be a very useful guide of what to expect, and also of how ready you actually are to take the real test. The questions also enable candidates to benchmark their performance, allowing users to learn about any areas of possible weakness that could be improved upon. Practice what you have learned, lots of our users say that using practice questions has given them the edge on taking the exam. Knowing you have taken the appropriate amount of time to prepare and also having a good idea of what to expect can take all of the stress out of the whole process.

**TIP:** Don’t take the test before you are ready! There’s nothing worse than an exam fail to fill you with self-doubt!


Sitting the Exam
----------------

You can mark questions for review and come back to them later- make use of this facility! One question can make the difference between a pass and a fail.  Note the questions you’re unsure of and review once you’ve answered every question.  Sometimes information is 'leaked' by later questions in the text that might provide you with enough information to choose the correct option on a question you were uncertain about.

Some questions have many right answers, but only one best answer.
Being a creative designer you know there are multiple ways to implement a solution so there were some questions where I could identify multiple “right” answers. However, Adobe wants you to choose the “best” answer.

There’s no way to pause the exam once you’ve started, so make sure you use the toilet beforehand, as you’re going to be sat in the test centre a while!

It's all too easy to be overwhelmed in an exam setting, letting your fear of failure stop you from focusing on the task at hand.  So try not to rush, keep a clear mind and try to enjoy yourself.

Beware trick questions. Many questions will have more than one answer that appears to make sense. Take your time, study the wording closely and choose the answer that seems most correct in the context of the question.

Don’t worry if you fail. If you do fail, you’ll have to wait 30 days to re-take, so spend that time brushing up on the questions you found hard (unfortunately you don’t get a breakdown of which questions you got wrong).
