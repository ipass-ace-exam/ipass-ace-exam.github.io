The choice to prepare for and sit the Adobe ACE exams is always going to be a good one. Though the personal reasons and incentives between everyone varies, it is going to be 	a sure-fire way to prove your skills and competence with the Adobe software.

**What is the advantage of passing the Adobe ACE exams?**

Passing an Adobe ACE exam sets you apart from the other competitors in your particular field – it shows that you can walk-the-walk. By adding reference to your success on your CV and/or your personal website, it can – quite literally – act like a badge of honour.

Apart from the recognition of passing the Adobe ACE exams and the potential career progression attached to this, it can also act as a great confidence boost and a springboard of inspiration.

**When is the right time to sit the Adobe ACE exams?**

This is a question that I have considered for quite some time. It is surely an opinionated question, since the right time to sit an exam is when YOU believe you're ready to. But often, it is not easy to deduce when you are fully prepared to take the leap.

It is important to know for sure and be confident in your decision to sit the exams, since you would not want to endure the cost of sitting one exam multiple times. We have collected together a few pointers for you to think about when deciding whether you're ready to sit the Adobe ACE exams:

* The most important point to remember is that you need to be confident in using the software that you are being reviewed on – this can take time. Think about how long you have used the software and allow this to form part of your decision.

* If you havn't used the software for long, don't fret. The more you use the software the more competent you will become and the higher the possibility that you will be successful when sitting the exams.

* When sitting the exams, you will NOT have access to the software you are being tested on. Because of this it is important to become accustomed to the interface, tools and functions that the software provides. When testing yourself using the [exam-style questions](https://www.ipassexam.com/c/adobe) , try to avoid having the software open alongside your browser – you need to ensure that you are not testing the software, but that you are testing your knowledge.

* If you find that sitting the [Adobe ACE exam-style questions](https://www.ipassexam.com/c/adobe)  is difficult or frustrating without having the software open, then this may be a sign that you need to prepare further before sitting the exams. Consider checking out the tutorials on Adobe support alongside the software to expand your knowledge and become better accustomed to what the software has to offer ([Adobe support for Creative Cloud](http://helpx.adobe.com/support.html), [Adobe support for Creative Suite](http://helpx.adobe.com/creative-suite.html)). Once you feel that you are ready, attempt the exam-style questions again to test your knowledge.

* Take note of how successful you are when sitting the [ACE practise questions](https://www.ipassexam.com/c/adobe) . If you find that you're performance is below par, then it might be worth concentrating on expanding your knowledge. Remember, doing this is not an admission of failure but proof that you're taking your education seriously and that in the end you will settle for nothing but success.

In summary, only you can say when you are ready to take the exam, but ensuring that you are well prepared will give you the best probability of success.
